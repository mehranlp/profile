    <ul>
      <li>
        <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/mehranlp/profile" target="_blank">Profile</a> - My Maximum Drawdonw dashboard. Maximum drawdown shows how much an investment drops from its peak before recovering. It’s a key metric for understanding potential losses and how long recovery might take. My project visualizes this for assets like the S&P 500 and Bitcoin, showing how wealth grows with steady contributions while tracking drawdowns. It’s especially useful for comparing investment strategies, assessing risk, and making sure a strategy aligns with an investor’s long-term goals.
