  <section id="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hi! I'm Mehran, a finance professional with over eight years of experience specializing in investment management and risk oversight. I work with a wide range of financial instruments and modeling techniques, with a focus on fixed income and derivatives. Over the years, I've built advanced tools for analysis and reporting, using Python and SQL to handle complex data, improve portfolio insights, and support better risk management.
    I enjoy building practical projects that solve real-world problems and am always looking to learn and grow in what I do.

    <div class="project-card">
      <a class="project-title" href="https://maximumdrawdown.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Maximum Drawdown Dashboard</a>
      <div class="project-description">
        Maximum drawdown shows how much an investment drops from its peak before recovering. It’s a key metric for understanding potential losses and how long recovery might take. This project visualizes drawdown and wealth growth over time for assets like major US equity indexes, Global Equity, Gold, Global Fixed Income index, and Bitcoin, using steady annual contributions. It’s especially helpful for comparing investment strategies, assessing risk tolerance, and evaluating long-term consistency across funds.

      <a class="project-title" href="https://multiasset-mp.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Multi-asset portfolio constriction, backtesting and correlation heatmap</a>
      <div class="project-description">
        This interactive Streamlit app allows users to construct and analyze custom multi-asset portfolios using popular ETFs. Users can select assets, adjust their portfolio weights with intuitive sliders, and visualize the resulting expected returns, volatility, and efficient frontier. The app also includes detailed visualizations such as daily return distributions, a correlation heatmap, and a backtest comparison against the SPY benchmark. Historical data is sourced from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance API, and key performance metrics such as realized return and risk are computed to aid investment decision-making. This tool demonstrates practical applications of financial data analysis, portfolio optimization, and interactive visualization in Python.
